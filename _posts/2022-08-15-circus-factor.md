[Minimize Your Circus Factor: Building resilient teams by Mercedes Bernard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBMSWBND0WU)

# My Take Aways

There are things you can do to have psychological safety in the team for your team members, and for you, to make it easier to take PTO for example, and to have better trust in your team members.

1. Document decision tradeoffs - Explain the tradeoffs to add context and justify the decision. Also perhaps worth, to some reasonable extent, including explanation of the decisions not taken.
2. Discuss documentation strategy vs effort - For different strategies, how useful is vs, how much time and care do you put into it.
3. Delegate leadership responsibilities - This helps others to learn what what is required, have more ownership, take more responsibility, have oppertunities to demonstrate leadership, and demonstrate to you that they can perform these duties while you take PTO.
4. Give updates in standups - Keep your team up-to-date with things that are going on off the board, this way they'll be in a better position to take somethign over if you are not available.
5. Share credentials (securly) - Ensure that your team has access to everything they might need while you are away.
