[Four Key Metrics Unleashed by Andrew Harmel-Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf1-B7a_QEs)

## My Take Aways

The four key metrics have proven their benefit in not just uplifting a teams "productivity" but improving many company metrics as well.

1. Just start collecting the metrics in a spreadsheet, and build your own barebones dashboard, so you can start extracting value.
2. You can iterate from there, improving on it as you go, automating the collection, improving the reporting, and adding more detail.
3. The deployment frequncy eventually goes to "on demand".
4. Becareful not to average an average, and use appropriate window sizes e.g. 31 days.
5. Elite is aspirational, once you're at or near that level, you may not need these metrics so much, but maybe it will help you highlight and give time for improvements in other areas.
