## My Take Aways

These all apply to remote teams:

1. The loss of adhoc chats, discussion, and opportunity for team boding in the office has been lost. 
2. It's better for leaders to over-communicate than under-communicate.
3. We need to be empathetic to everyones work environment and the constraints they are under when working from home.
4. It's also impacted estimation meetings since they are not as smooth when remote. Instead a no-estimates approach may be appealing.
