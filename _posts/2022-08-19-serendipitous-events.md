[Serendipitous Events](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-gb/insights/podcasts/technology-podcasts/serendipitous-events)

## My Take Aways

1. Historically companies would do big design up front, build too much and it wasn't all used and was wasteful.
2. The counter position is to only build what's needed, but this can limit opportunities and make collaboration harder. 
3. Instead it's worth thinking hard to strike a balance, and be prepared to share domain events or APIs internally within a company so that other teams can levarage them in new and perhaps unexpected ways.
4. Another challenge that must be tackled though is promoting your newly exposed data sources, if no one finds out about them, then there's no point either.
5. Maintainance costs must be considered too, and teams should be preapared to remove something if it's not delivering value but is costing time and money.
6. If adding a field to an event is cheap and might be useful, and backwards compatible, then it's worth thinking about the opportunity cost of not including it.
