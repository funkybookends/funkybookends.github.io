[Continuous Delivery in 4 months for 15 teams and their single monolith - Thierry de Pauw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUIOYIQ1yTA)

## My Take Aways

1. It is possible to have a transformational change in a short amount of time in a business.
2. You need buy in from a motivated group of people.
3. You need to work fast, and go around the people who will slow you down - "why do you plan to make this change?", "whoops sorry it's already done."
4. The improvement kata can work very well. 1. Understand the direction, 2. Grasp the current situation, 3. Establish your next target condition, 4. Conduct experiment to get there.
5. You can use value stream mapping to find the bottleneck, and that's where you should focus your attention.
6. Creating an open environment where people can raise their concerns and fears is important, and then we need to work to mitigate those fears.
7. Technological changes needed for contiunous delivery:
  - Version control
  - Trunk based development
  - Deployment pipeline
  - Continuous integration
  - Automated configuration
  - Automated infrastructure
  - Evolutionary Architecture
  - Database migrations
  - Test driven development
  - Acceptance Test Driven Development
  - Contract Tests
  - Exploratory Testing
  - Smoke Tests
  - Test Data Management
  - Monitoring & Alerting
  - Incremental Releases
8. Organisational changes for continuous delivery:
  - Small batch sizes
  - Empowered Product Teams
  - Cross-Functional teams
  - Shared Incentives
  - Blameless post-mortems
  - You build it, you run it
  - Everyone does on-call
  - Continuous change review
  - Tracability of changes
  - Upskilling and empowering employees
  - Conway's law alignment
  - Continuous improvement
