[Beyond Blameless by Rein Henrichs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2CdjZUAmb0)

## My Take Aways

When doing a postmortem we need to create the right atmosphere to make it clear that punishment and retribution are not acceptable. We should assume that everyone is doing there best. Followup actions should be to enforce norms and best practices, without being personal.
