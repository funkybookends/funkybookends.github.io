[Outcome-based Product Planning by Jeff Gothelf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm4lVtLxQy4)

## My Take Aways

1. Linear product planning, i.e. a road map, does not apply anymore, it constrains us too much and is anti-agility.
2. Continuous delivery allows us to go really fast, get features into users hands very quickly.
3. If we make a long term plan, by the time we get there, or half way through, it may not make sense anymore. The context may have changed.
4. We have to switch from asking "what will we build?" to "what will people be doing differently if we succeed?". Measure the outcome, not the output.
5. Use OKRS:
6. Objectives are long term themes that might last multiple quarters. Something to address a clear business problem, converted into a positive goal.
7. Key Results are measurable changes in behaviour that we can measure. Not an implementation. Set roughly quarterly. To help figure them out, ask "what will people be doing differently if we have succeded in our objective?".
8. Key Results are accompanied by hypothesis of how we might achieve this, what we might actually build, these are up for discussion, and it reflects our uncertainty. "We belive if we build ..., then we will see this ...". These become your quarterly activities.
9. In the short term it might be clear what we can do, but the further out in time we might be more unsure, and that's OK.
10. Check in periodically to see how we're trending on those Key Results. Just in time planning on a quarterly basis. But these should be forward looking conversations.
11. Deciding what to do next is looking at your hypothesis and determining what's the biggest risk, and then deciding whats the smallest piece of work we can do to learn about that and turning that into your experiment.
12. Teams need to expose what the team is working on. Radical transparency and tend towards over communication.
13. Decisions need to be backed up with data, and that needs to be exposed so that others can understand when a team pivots.
14. Sales: should be selling the benefit, not the feature. And that can allow the team to be unsure about exactly what feature they are delivery. Sales and the team are aligned on the benefits.
