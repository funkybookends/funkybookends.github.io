[No estimates by Vasco Duarte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgvB2wWvi8M)

## My Take Aways

* No estimates is as scary as TDD was when it was first proposed.
* Estimates are not actually of any value to the customer.
* Estimations pre-suppose an order, but the order changes, and so estimates are easily "invalidated" (if it was valid at all. Software is in the complex domain where reductionsim does not work.
* You only estimate if you have a plan. But we should be responding to change over having a plan. So the estimates actually tie you to the plan, making it harder to be agile.
* 1. Select the most important piece of work you need to do, 2. Break that work down in to risk-neutral chunks of work (a chunk of work, so that if it can fail safely), 3. Develop each piece of work, 4. Iterate and refactor.
* The system (/team) is unstable if a) velocity is outside of limits 3 times in a row, or b) There are 5 or more points in sequence.
* Just counting the number of stories is more accurate the story points.
