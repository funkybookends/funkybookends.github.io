[To Pair or Not to Pair: Pair Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_eZ-ae2FY8)

## My Take Aways

1. 1+1>2
2. "I get more pair programming productivity out of reducing the time that I'm stuck than from increasing my speed when I'm not stuck" - Chris Ford (@ctford)
3. Allows two modes of thinking to happen simultaenously, a tactical view of this current code issue, and a strategic view of the whole story/problem.
4. The benefits are not in the short term, they are in the medium to long term. This is probably especially true when it's a skill the people on the team are learning.
5. Helps improve focus, for the pairers and the team.
6. Aviods a sunk cost fallicy during code review - "this isn't great, but it's not worth asking for it to change"
7. Don't expect to pair 8 hours a day, it is draining, plan smaller chunks.
8. It's difficult to expose your vulnerabilities during pair programming - show that you don't know keyboard shurtcuts for example.
9. Diverse teams, which are more vulnerable, perform better. 
10. You can find ways to make it fun.
