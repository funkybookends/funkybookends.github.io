[Sabotaging an Agile Transformation by Fred George](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cDpLVuQXEo)

## My Take Aways

1. There are lots of people that intentionally or unintentionally get in the way of an agile transformation. 
2. There are multiple sources of stress that cause people anxiety about the change, which can be disruptive.
3. Speed is a big source of stress. The organisation might not be ready for being always ready to ship.
4. Active Saboteurs:
  - Indivduals losing power - people who have exclusive knowledge, or who are used to signing-off things.
  - Process impedanec mismatch - people who are stuck to a process. Can be UI/UX or DB or Architecture people.
  - Jelousy of success - people wo minimize accomplishments
5. Mitigation strategies
  - Stalin Strategy - avoid confruntation, get more and more people to agree with you and convince everyone to ignore them.
  - Sandwich strategy - find the highest person in the company and tell them what's gonna happen, what culture you're gonna change. And then go to the teams and get them onboard. Ignore everyone in the middle.
  - Inject superior competence - someone who can show how it's done.
  - Remove the change agent - A culture will form against the person disrupting the company. At some point that person will be "shot", if you don't want that to be you, get someone else to do it.
6. Organisational Saboteurs:
  - Success Conservatism - Once one team gets good, that positive change is contained within that team and not allowed to spread.
  - Titles - inhibits story cycle time because of handoffs. A kind of waterfall thinking. Locks people into what they can and can't do.
  - Seating of employees - don't sit departments together. co-locating is huge boost to communication
  - Organisational Oversight - standards, review boards, permissions required.
  - Hiring process experts over empowering developers
  - Reluctance to invest in contractors.
7. Other types of sabotage
  - Social (cultural) sabotage
  - Indirect (accidental) sabotage
8. Other mitigation techniques
  - Label efforts as experiments - it's hard to argue against experiments
  - Continuous executive involvement
  - Find and kill fear which is inhibiting innovation
  - Shield team from normal business chaos.
  - Practice agile schizophrenia
  - Use reference executives and developers - point to others who have done
