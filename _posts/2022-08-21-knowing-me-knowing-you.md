[Knowing Me, Knowing You - Growing Teams to Continuously Deliver - Pia Nilsson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S92vVAEofes)

## My Take Aways

1. Adding WIP limits, TDD & DDD, Pair Programming increased friction and did make it less "fun" to work on a team, but there are ways to improve this.
2. Improve psychological safety by allowing more vulnerability.
3. Add a section in our retrospectives for showing appreciation.
4. Improve communication by encourage "yes and" over "yes but", and more compassionate listening.
5. Learn how to give friendly feedback, use non-violent communication (NVC)
6. You don't always need to focus on the negatives and fixing them, an alternative is to focus on the good things, and encourage more of them.
