[Improving Observability and Testing In Production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nmu4URA7pSM)

## My Take Aways

1. Testing in production is an additional type of testing, we should still prioritize finding issues as soon as possible in your pipeline.
2. We can treat observability, using alerts and monitors, as a "test in production"
3. Smoke testing can be very valuable
4. A/B testing and more generous use of feature flags are a form of testing in production.
