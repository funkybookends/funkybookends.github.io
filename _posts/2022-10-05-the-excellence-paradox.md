[The Excellence Paradox - Gareth Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Y9buXflews)

## My Take Aways

1. The best products are built with awful technical practices.
2. Some really successfull companies have been built by people who are, or who are very close to the customers.
3. Ruthless attention to the customer is what you need to be successful initially.
4. But you need attention to technical excellence in order to be sustainable.
5. Focus on what is needed now, don't get distracted by architecting for scale you may never have. It's cheaper to just have a plan for what you would do if you do need to scale. 
6. Don't fix what isn't broken.
7. Respect the legacy - it works and is paying your wages.
8. Never let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
