## My Take Aways

1. Previous work is not a good place to start estimating new work, as the new work is work you haven't done before.
2. Estimates are always wrong, and we use them, even though we always know that they are wrong.
3. Putting estimates can create dysfunction. The estimates create deadlines, creates pressure, and then makes working unsustainable, and that leads to dsyfunction.
4. Estimtaes also might force a commitment to delivering something that's been esitmated, but if you delivered the wrong thing, then the estimate has activly hurt you deliver the right thing.
5. Story points, or anything else analgous, created to make obscure time will fail, someone will always try to tie it back to time.
6. The further away something is likely to be done, the more crazy and wasteful it is to put an estimate on it. There's so many things in front of it that are likely to impact that estimate.
7. Lean priciples encourage us to remove anything that doesn't deliver value to customers. Estimates don't deliver value and so should be binned as well.
8. Estimating all stories as 1 point can get just a final completion date very close to the fibbonaci story point estimates - doesn't that show that it's wasteful. This probably means that the best thing to do is to try and get all stories the same size, and just count the number of stories.
